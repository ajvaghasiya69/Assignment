    <h1>Module (JAVASCRIPT BASIC & DOM) â€“ 4</h1> 
   
<h4>What is JavaScript?</h4>
<p><b>Ans.</b>JavaScript is a high-level, versatile, and dynamically typed programming language primarily known for its role in web development.</p>
             <h4>
                What is the use of isNaN function?

             </h4>  
             <p><b>Ans.</b>The isNaN function in JavaScript is used to determine whether a value is NaN (Not a Number).</p> 
             <h4>What is negative Infinity?</h4>
             <p><b>Ans.</b>Negative Infinity is a special value in JavaScript that represents the concept of negative infinity, or a value that is smaller (more negative) than any other number.</p>  
             <h4>Which company developed JavaScript?</h4>
             <p><b>Ans.</b>JavaScript was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation, a technology company </p>
             <h4>Whatis Undeclare and Indefine Variable</h4>
             <p><b>Ans.</b>An undeclared variable is a variable that has been used in code without being declared using the var, let, or const keyword. <br>An undefined variable is a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value</p> 
             <h4>Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?
            </h4>
            <p><b>Ans.</b><pre>
                // Creating a new paragraph element
                let newParagraph = document.createElement('p');
              
                // Adding text content to the paragraph
                newParagraph.textContent = 'This is a dynamically added paragraph.';
              
                // Appending the new paragraph to the body of the document
                document.body.appendChild(newParagraph);
            </pre></p> 
            <h4>What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h4>
            <p><b>Ans.</b><pre>
                ViewState and SessionState are concepts associated with web development, particularly in the context of ASP.NET. These terms refer to different mechanisms for managing state in web applications.

ViewState:
Scope:

ViewState is specific to a single web page.
It is used to persist state information between multiple requests for the same page.
Storage:

The ViewState is stored as a hidden field on the page, and it travels back and forth between the server and the client along with the page.
Lifetime:

ViewState is short-lived and exists only during the lifetime of a single page. It does not persist across different pages.
Usage:

It is commonly used to store information that needs to be maintained across postbacks on the same page.
SessionState:
Scope:

SessionState is broader in scope and is not tied to a specific page.
It is used to persist user-specific data across multiple requests and pages during a user's session.
Storage:

SessionState is typically stored on the server side, and a session identifier is used to associate the stored data with a specific user.
Lifetime:

SessionState lasts for the duration of a user's session, which begins when the user accesses the application and ends when the user closes the browser or remains inactive for a specified period.
Usage:

It is commonly used to store user-specific information such as user preferences, authentication details, or any other data that needs to be maintained throughout a user's visit to the application.

            <h4>What is === operator?</h4>

            <p><b>Ans.</b>The === operator is the strict equality operator in JavaScript. It is used for comparing two values for equality without performing type coercion.</p>
            <h4>How can the style/class of an element be changed?
            </h4>
            <p><b>Ans.</b><b>for changing style</b>
                <body>

                  <pre>
                    div id="myDiv">This is a div/div>
                    
                    script>
                      // Get the element by its ID
                      let myDiv = document.getElementById("myDiv");
                    
                      // Change the background color
                      myDiv.style.backgroundColor = "lightblue";
                    /script>
                    /body>
                  </pre>
                    <b>For Changing Class</b>
                    <pre>
                        <div id="myDiv">This is a div</div>

script>
  // Get the element by its ID
  let myDiv = document.getElementById("myDiv");

  // Add a class to the element
  myDiv.classList.add("highlight");

  // Remove a class from the element after a delay
  setTimeout(() => {
    myDiv.classList.remove("highlight");
  }, 2000);
/script>
                    </pre>
                    </p>
                    <h4>How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</h4>
                    <p><b>Ans.</b>In a browser environment, JavaScript doesn't have direct access to the file system for security reasons. However, you can interact with files indirectly through user interactions, such as file input elements or drag-and-drop operations. I</p>
  
  <h4>What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</h4>
  <p><b>Ans</b><b>for loop</b>
<pre>for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  </pre>
<b>While loop</b>
<pre>let i = 0;
    while (i < 5) {
      console.log(i);
      i++;
    }
    </pre>
<b>Do while</b><pre>
    let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);

</pre>
<b>For in</b><pre>const myObject = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
    for (let key in myObject) {
      console.log(key, myObject[key]);
    }
    </pre>
<b>For off</b><pre>
    const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let value of myArray) {
  console.log(value);
}

</pre></p>
<h4>How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</h4>
<p><b>Ans.</b><pre>
    let base36String = "zy";
let decimalNumber = parseInt(base36String, 36);

console.log(decimalNumber); // Outputs: 1295

</pre></p>
<h4>What is the function of the delete operator?</h4>
<p><b>Ans.</b>The delete operator in JavaScript is used to delete properties from objects and elements from arrays. </p>
                    
<h4>What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?
</h4>
<p><b>Ans.</b>In JavaScript, there are three types of pop-up boxes that you can use to interact with the user: alert, confirm, and prompt.</p>
<h4>What is the use of Void (0)?</h4>
<p><b>Ans.</b>The use of void(0) is often seen in the context of JavaScript and HTML, especially when working with hyperlinks (<a> tags) and preventing the default behavior of the browser</p>
    <h4>How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</h4>
    <p><b>Ans.</b>In JavaScript, you can force a page to load another page by setting the window.location property to the URL of the page you want to load</p>
    <h4>What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
    </h4><p><b>Ans.</b><pre>
        Security Risks (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS):

Using innerHTML to insert content into the DOM can expose your application to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the inserted content is not properly sanitized. If user inputs are directly injected into the HTML using innerHTML, malicious scripts might be executed in the context of your web page.
Performance Impact:

Manipulating the innerHTML property involves parsing and rendering the HTML content. If you frequently update large portions of the DOM using innerHTML, it can have a performance impact, especially on slower devices or when dealing with complex DOM structures.
Event Handlers and Data Binding:

When using innerHTML to update content, existing event handlers and data bindings associated with the modified elements may be lost. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially if you're working with frameworks or libraries that rely on these event handlers or data bindings.
Potential for Code Injection:

If you are dynamically building HTML content by concatenating strings, there's a risk of unintentional code injection if you're not careful. Improperly sanitized user inputs or external data may lead to unintentional code execution or HTML structure manipulation.
Limited Error Handling:

When using innerHTML, it may be challenging to handle errors related to the correctness of the inserted HTML. If the inserted HTML has syntax errors, it might result in unexpected behavior, and error handling is not as straightforward as when using DOM manipulation methods.
Loss of Scroll Position:

If you are using innerHTML to modify the content of a container with a scrollbar, it may cause the scroll position to reset. This can be disruptive for users, especially if they are partway down a long page.
